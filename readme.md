# .NET C# Projects 
## Introduction 

This project contains a showcase of the C# .NET projects which I have undertaken and actively working on. This includes a game of life simuator that runs in a console and also under Gtk#, a simple Gtk# based contact database and a BitTorrent client using the Terminal.Gui text based library. 

### GameOfLife
This is just a version of conways game of life https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life the was developed in C# on monodevelop under linux. There is both a console and Gtk# variant tha can be build and run.

### ContactsDB
A simple contacts database written in C#/Gtk# on monodevelop. It currently supports backend storage of either SQLite or a simple CSV file and may be easily adapted to any other database that is required.

### BitTorrent
This is a from the grounds up BitTorrent client written in C#/.NET using visual studio code under linux. Its contains a core class library BitTorrentLibrary that supports the downloading and uploading of torrents, a suite of unit tests BitTorrentLibraryTests for it and a text based client that makes use of the library to download and seed torrent files.
