# .NET C# Projects #

## Introduction ##

This project contains a showcase of the C# .NET projects which I have undertaken and actively working on. This includes a game of life simuator that runs in a console and also under Gtk#, a simple Gtk# based contact database and a BitTorrent client using the Terminal.Gui text based library.
